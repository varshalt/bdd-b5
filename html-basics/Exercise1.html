                <h4> 1. Business Travel</h4>
                <p>A business trip is a trip undertaken for work or business purposes, as opposed to other types of travel, 
                such as for leisure purposes or regularly commuting between one’s home and workplace.</p>
                <p>Going on family vacations or with friends of course has a different planning to do than when it’s about a business trip. 
                The needs while being on a business trip are always different.</p>

                <h4>2. Solo Travel</h4>
                <p>Solo travel means you’re going somewhere else alone, where you will spend a significant chunk of time alone once you get there. 
                Traveling alone is not uncommon and most solo travelers are able to meet other travelers at hostels, bars, 
                organized tours or any place where travelers tend to hang out or congregate.</p>
                <p>Traveling alone is a unique experience and can be a very rewarding way of traveling.</p>

                <h4>3. Family Travel</h4>
                <p>Just because you’ve settled down and have kids doesn’t mean your adventuring days are through. 
                Traveling with a family is a completely different beast than traveling solo or as a couple.
                </p>
                <p>Traveling with a group is another must-do. Traveling in a group means you are sharing the experience with others who have a similar mindset, 
                creating great conversations and bonding experiences. At the same time, you’re widening your circle of companions who share similar interests for free-time exploration.

                <h4>4. Travel with Friends</h4>
                <p>When we travel with our friends, those memories become even more priceless in our bank of golden experiences. Exploring a different country, 
                conquering fears together and discovering new perspectives ultimately progresses our relationships to levels never imagined possible. 
                Embarking on a journey with your friends is an unpredictable voyage that every person should experience at least once in his or her life.</p>
                <p>Traveling with a group is another must-do. Traveling in a group means you are sharing the experience with others who have a similar mindset, creating great conversations and bonding experiences. 
                At the same time, you’re widening your circle of companions who share similar interests for free-time exploration.</p>
